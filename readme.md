   ```

## üìë Learning Path

**Follow this recommended order** to build your knowledge progressively:

### 1. [**Variables & Data Types**](./variables.js) üèóÔ∏è
- Variable declaration (`let`, `const`, `var`)
- Primitive data types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined)
- Complex data types (arrays, objects)
- Scope and hoisting concepts

### 2. [**Conditionals & Logic**](./conditionals.js) üß†
- `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements
- Comparison and logical operators
- Ternary operator for concise conditions
- Switch statements for multiple conditions

### 3. [**Loops & Iteration**](./loops.js) üîÑ
- `for` loops for counting and iteration
- `while` and `do...while` loops
- Array iteration methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`)
- Breaking and continuing loop execution

### 4. [**Objects & Methods**](./objects.js) üì¶
- Object creation and property access
- Methods and `this` keyword
- Object destructuring
- Prototypes and inheritance basics

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Repository

### For Beginners
1. **Start with `variables.js`** and work through each file in order
2. **Read the comments carefully** - they explain every concept
3. **Run each file** to see the output: `node filename.js`
4. **Experiment freely** - modify the code and see what happens!

### For Practice
- **Try the challenges** included in each file
- **Break the code intentionally** to understand error messages
- **Write your own examples** using the patterns you learn

### Study Tips üí°
- **Don't rush** - understanding is more important than speed
- **Practice regularly** - even 15 minutes daily makes a difference
- **Ask questions** - use the issues section if you're stuck
- **Teach others** - explain concepts to reinforce your learning

## üö¶ Quick Reference

### Running Examples
```bash
# Run any JavaScript file
node filename.js

# Examples:
node variables.js     # Learn about data storage
node conditionals.js  # Practice decision making
node loops.js         # Master repetition
node objects.js       # Understand data structures
```

### Common Commands
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Run JavaScript code directly
node -e "console.log('Hello, World!')"

# Exit Node.js REPL
.exit
```

## üìà Progress Tracking

Keep track of your learning journey:

- [ ] **Variables**: Understand all data types and scoping rules
- [ ] **Conditionals**: Can write complex conditional logic
- [ ] **Loops**: Comfortable with all loop types and array methods
- [ ] **Objects**: Can create and manipulate objects confidently
- [ ] **Integration**: Can combine all concepts in small projects

## üí™ Practice Challenges

Ready to test your skills? Try these mini-projects:

1. **Calculator** - Create a simple calculator using functions
2. **To-Do List** - Build a command-line task manager
3. **Number Guessing Game** - Practice loops and conditionals
4. **Student Grade Manager** - Work with objects and arrays
5. **Simple Quiz App** - Combine all concepts learned

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"node is not recognized"**
- Make sure Node.js is installed and added to your PATH
- Restart your terminal after installation

**Syntax Errors**
- Check for missing semicolons, brackets, or quotes
- Use a code editor with syntax highlighting

**Logic Errors**
- Add `console.log()` statements to debug your code
- Use the browser's developer tools for web-based code

### Getting Help
- üìñ Read the error messages carefully - they often tell you exactly what's wrong
- üîç Search for error messages online (Stack Overflow is your friend!)
- üí¨ Use the repository's Issues section to ask questions
- üë• Join JavaScript communities on Discord or Reddit

## üìö Follow Along

## üìö Detailed Learning Guide

### 1. **Variables & Data Types** üìä
**What you'll master:**
- Understand the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`
- Work with strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects
- Learn about variable scope and the concept of hoisting
- Practice type conversion and checking data types

**Key concepts:**
```javascript
// Variable declaration
let changeable = "I can be modified";
const permanent = "I cannot be reassigned";

// Data types
let text = "Hello World";        // String
let number = 42;                 // Number
let isTrue = true;              // Boolean
let list = [1, 2, 3];          // Array
let person = {name: "John"};    // Object
```

### 2. **Conditionals & Decision Making** üß†
**What you'll master:**
- Control program flow with `if`, `else if`, and `else`
- Use comparison operators (`===`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, etc.)
- Combine conditions with logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Write clean code with ternary operators and switch statements

**Key concepts:**
```javascript
// Basic conditional
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You can vote!");
} else {
    console.log("Too young to vote");
}

// Ternary operator
const message = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
```

### 3. **Loops & Repetition** üîÑ
**What you'll master:**
- Automate repetitive tasks with different loop types
- Iterate through arrays and objects efficiently

- Control loop execution with `break` and `continue`

**Key concepts:**
```javascript
// For loop
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(`Count: ${i}`);
}

// Array iteration
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num * 2));
```

### 4. **Objects & Data Structures** üì¶
**What you'll master:**
- Create and manipulate JavaScript objects
- Understand methods and the `this` keyword
- Work with object properties and destructuring
- Explore basic concepts of prototypes and inheritance

**Key concepts:**
```javascript
// Object creation
const car = {
    brand: "Toyota",
    model: "Camry",
    start: function() {
        console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} is starting!`);
    }
};
```
